# MDIP: Multi Dimensional Identity Protocol

## Coming Soon: Experimental-Alpha Release in Spring 2024

The MDIP DID method conforms to the W3C Credentials Community Group [DID specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). For more information about DIDs and DID method specifications, please see the [DID Primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot12-cologne/blob/main/advance-readings/did-primer.md).
The MDIP Verifiable Credential (VC) functionality conforms with the W3C [VC Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/). 

The MDIP DID method (did:mdip) is designed to support a P2P identity layer with secure decentralized attestations (VCs). MDIP DIDs are used for agents (e.g., users, issuers, verifiers, and MDIP nodes) and assets (e.g., verifiable credentials, verifiable presentations, schemas, challenges, and responses).
